How to create new examples under the MRPT tree:
--------------------------------------------------------

1) Go to [MRPT]/samples

2) Create a directory with the example name, e.g. "foo" ->
   [MRPT]/samples/foo/

3) Create the C++ file and save it as "test.cpp":
   [MRPT]/samples/foo/test.cpp

4) Add the example name to any of the lists in:
   [MRPT]/cmakemodules/DefineExamples.cmake

5) In the build directory, run "cmake . -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON"

6) An automatically generated CMake script will be created in:
   [MRPT]/samples/foo/CMakeLists.txt

7) Add both files to the repository:
   git add [MRPT]/samples/foo/CMakeLists.txt [MRPT]/samples/foo/test.cpp

done!
