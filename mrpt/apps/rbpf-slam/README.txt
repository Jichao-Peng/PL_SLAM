 DESCRIPTION
--------------

This application implements a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF)-based solution to SLAM.

It is actually a front-end for the class MRML::CMetricMapBuilderRBPF. All the parameters to the
algorithm are passed through a config file in the command line. The filter processes actions and
observations from a rawlog file and optionally generates a number of files describing the evolution
of the filter and the maps.

 COMPILING
--------------
