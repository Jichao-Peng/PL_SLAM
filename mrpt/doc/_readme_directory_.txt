The "docs" directory contains the documentation generated by doxygen. 

See the directory "scripts" for instruction on rebuilding the MRPT documentation.
In Linux, can also do a "make documentation_html". 

The directory "images" is for temporary stored images. Add new images to "design_of_images"
or "screenshots" if they are referenced in the doxygen documentation.
