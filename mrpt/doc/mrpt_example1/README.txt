This directory contains an example of a minimal user application which 
uses the MRPT libraries. It assumes MRPT has already been compiled or 
(in Unix) installed in the system.

Invoking 
- In Windows: "cmakesetup ."
- Unix: "ccmake ."

should be enough to create the Makefiles. Then invoke "make" to compile the
program. You may have to specify the location of the MRPT & wxWidgets 
directories as CMake ask you for them interactively. For more instructions 
see the wiki page:
