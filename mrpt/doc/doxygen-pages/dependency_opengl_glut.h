<h2>Dependency: <code>opengl</code> and <code>glut</code></h2>
<hr>

This optional library is required to render 3D graphics. It is fundamentally used by the classes in mrpt::opengl.

Note however that nothing prevents you from creating objects in mrpt::opengl, manipulating them, building 3D scenes, saving them to disk, etc. even without OpenGL support. 
An exception will be raised only if you try to render them in a mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D or by any other mean.
