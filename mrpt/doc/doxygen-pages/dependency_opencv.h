<h2>Dependency: <code>opencv</code></h2>
<hr>

This optional library is used for almost everything related to computer vision in MRPT. Even MRPT-specific computer vision functions or classes cannot work without OpenCV since the basic structure for holding images is OpenCV's <code>IplImage</code>. 

If not present, the following classes will raise an exception upon usage:
- mrpt::utils::CImage. Note that creating mrpt::utils::CImage objects in the "external storage mode" will not raise an exception unless you really access the image contents.
- Everything needing access to an image (loading, saving, processing, etc.).
