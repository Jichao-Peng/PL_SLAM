ARIA Installation Instructions
===============================

ARIA software development is supported on Windows 2000 using MS Visual 
Studio 2003/.NET (7) and on GNU/Linux using GNU development tools (make, 
GCC).

See README.txt for more information.


Windows:
--------

Run the Aria-<version>.exe to invoke the setup program, then simply
follow the prompts.  All ARIA software will be installed in 
C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\Aria.  Shortcuts will be installed
in the Start menu to documentation, examples, and the Aria directory.

The kit includes the Aria library and two pre-built examples
that you can run from the bin directory. To see more examples, 
open Microsoft Visual Studio and load the example projects
(examples\examples.sln).

In order to compile ARIA and the examples, you should use Microsoft 
Visual C++ .net 2003. 

We have discontinued support Visual C++ 6.0.  We only support Visual
C++ .net 2003 now.  We switched to Visual C++ .net since it was no
longer possible to obtain Visual C++ 6.0 and we are now discontinuing
support for Visual C++ 6.0.  The libraries compiled between the two
versions in our experience do not work either forwardly compatible or
backwardly compatible.  A copy of Visual C++ .net can be purchased for
less than $100 US.

If you really want to use Visual C++ 6.0 the old files are in the
vc++6 directory, see the README.txt in that directory, note that these
files are unsupported.


GNU/Linux:
----------

To use the precompiled Aria library under Linux, you will need GCC 3.4 
(with the C++ compiler, g++) and Make.  You should be able to compile Aria
from scratch with just about any c++ compiler you'd like, you can do this 
by typing 'make clean; make' in the top level directory (/usr/local/Aria).
You can set environment variables to affect compilation, such as CXX and
CXXFLAGS. 

The Aria library (libAria.so) and two pre-built examples are included.
You can run these examples from the bin directory and you can find
more examples in the examples directory.  All ARIA software is placed
in /usr/local/Aria.  In addition, the file /etc/Aria will be created with 
the ARIA installation location, and /etc/ld.so.conf may be updated to 
include /usr/local/Aria/lib. 


To install on RedHat:
---------------------

For RedHat, the ARIA and ArNetworking libraries are provided by the
"ARIA" RPM package, which provides libAria, libArNetworking, all 
documentation, source code, example programs, and Java and Python
wrapper libraries.

To install the ARIA RPM package, log in as the 'root' user, or use the
'su' command to become root. Then install with 'rpm':
   rpm -i ARIA-$ARIAMAJOR.$MINOR-$BUILD.i386.rpm

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.

To upgrade an existing ARIA install use 'rpm -U' instead of 'rpm -i'.  
To remove  the currently installed Aria package, use:
   rpm -e ARIA
   
See the documentation for 'rpm' for more options:
   man rpm


To install on Debian:
---------------------

ARIA libraries are provided by the following Debian packages: libaria, 
libaria-python, libaria-java.  libaria provides libArNetworking as well 
as libAria, and all documentation, source code, and example programs.
libaria-python and libaria-java provide the Python and Java wrapper 
libraries respectively.

To install a .deb package file downloaded from the website, use dpkg:
   dpkg -i libaria_$ARIAMAJOR.$MINOR.$BUILD_i386.deb

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.

You may also need to install dependencies using aptitude, synaptic, or 
apt-get.

To uninstall the ARIA libraries, use 'apt-get remove libaria'. Any
packages that depend on libaria will also be removed.

An online Internet repository for use with the apt-get, aptitude, and
synaptic tools will be available soon.


To install on other GNU/Linux systems:
--------------------------------------

Many Linux systems use either the RPM or DEB packaging formats, or
a tool such as "alien" can be used to convert.  Alternatively, you
may download the source code as a compressed 'tar' archive and 
compile Aria yourself (See README.txt for notes about compiling 
the source).

Unpack the .tar.gz archive:
   tar xzvf ARIA-$ARIAMAJOR.$MINOR.$BUILD.tar.gz

Enter the new directory, and use make to build ARIA:
   cd Aria-$ARIAMAJOR.$MINOR.$BUILD
   make

To install Aria, become the root user and use make again:
   su
   ...
   make install

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.   The dynamic (shared) 
libraries are in /usr/local/Aria/lib and the header files are in
/usr/local/Aria/include and /usr/local/Aria/ArNetworking/include.

Next, you will then need to tell the dynamic linker where to find the ARIA 
libraries: either add "/usr/local/Aria/lib" to /etc/ld.so.conf for 
permanent effect, or add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable 
for temporary effect.

All future development should use the installed Aria, not the source
you unpacked, so that directory may be removed.
