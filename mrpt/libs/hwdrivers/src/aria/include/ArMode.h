/// A class for different modes, mostly as related to keyboard input
/**
  Each mode is going to need to add its keys to the keyHandler...
  each mode should only use the keys 1-0, the arrow keys (movement),
  the space bar (stop), z (zoom in), x (zoom out), and e (exercise)...
  then when its activate is called by that key handler it needs to
  first deactivate the ourActiveMode (if its not itself, in which case
  its done) then add its key handling stuff... activate and deactivate
  will need to add and remove their user tasks (or call the base class
  activate/deactivate to do it) as well as the key handling things for
  their other part of modes.  This mode will ALWAYS bind help to /, ?, h,
  and H when the first instance of an ArMode is made.
