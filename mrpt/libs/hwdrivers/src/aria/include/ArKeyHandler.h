/// This class will read input from the keyboard
/**
   This class is for handling input from the keyboard, you just
   addKeyHandler the keys you want to deal with.

   You should also register the keyhandler with Aria::setKeyHandler,
   and before you create a key handler you should see if one is
   already there with Aria::getKeyHandler.
   
   You can attach a key handler to a robot with
   ArRobot::attachKeyHandler which will put a task into the robots
   list of tasks so that it'll get checked every cycle or you can just
   call checkKeys yourself (like in its own thread or in the main
   thread).  You should only attach a key handler to one robot, even
   if you're using multiple robots.
