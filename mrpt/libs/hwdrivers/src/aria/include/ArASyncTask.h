/// Asynchronous task (runs in its own thread)
/**
   The ArAsynTask is a task that runs in its own thread. This is a
   rather simple class. The user simply needs to derive their own
   class from ArAsyncTask and define the runThread() function. They
   then need to create an instance of their task and call run or
   runAsync. The standard way to stop a task is to call stopRunning()
   which sets ArThread::myRunning to false. In their run loop, they
   should pay attention to the getRunning() or the ArThread::myRunning
   variable. If this value goes to false, the task should clean up
   after itself and exit its runThread() function.

     Override this function and put your taskes run loop here. Check the
     value of getRunning() periodicly in your loop. If the value
     is false, the loop should exit and runThread() should return.
     The argument and return value are specific to the platform thread implementation, and
