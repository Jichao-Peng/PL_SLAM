/// Use onboard gyro to improve the heading in an ArRobot object's pose value
/**
   The gyro is an accessory connected to the robot's microcontroller.
   The gyro's purpose is to improve large errors due to wheel
   slippage, wheels coming off the ground, and other factors like this
   (or for the skid steer of an AT). The gyro also happens to provide
   temperature readings as well.

   When an ArAnalogGyro object is created, it registers callbacks with the
   robot, and automatic heading correction will begin when new data arrives
   from the robot.
   If you delete the object, it will remove itself from the robot.

   The readings come back from the gyro over the robot microcontroller's analog ports.
   The microcontroller then sends the readings to us just before
   sending us the standard packet.  ArAnalogGyro uses these  readings to
   calculate a better heading of the robot (integrating the velocities to
   give position).  Then when the standard packet comes in, ArRobot calls
   an encoder correction callback in ArAnalogGyro which does a simple
   Kalman filter and fuses the encoder information's heading with the gyro's heading
   to compute the most probable heading which it then returns to the
   ArRobot object to use as its heading.

   The robot's normal dead reconing angle is fairly good if you have properly
   inflated tires (if you have pneumatic tires) and if you have
   the revcount parameter sent correctly.  See the robot operation manual for
   how to change the revcount parameter.

   Gyro readings are affected by temperature (a temperature value
   is reported along with the gyro data in the packets from the
   microcontroller).  The gyro will auto calibrate itself to the
   center of the range (which may have drifted due to temperature)
   whenever the robot is stationary for more than one second (that is, if its
   translational and rotational velocities are less than 1
   and if the gyro readings are also within .5% of the average).  The
   scaling factor (between change of voltage and amount of turn)
   doesn't seem to change due to temperature, though it can vary among
   different gyro devices.  (This scaling factor can be accessed with
   getScalingFactor() and setScalingFactor().)
   The default value used here was within 3% of correct most of the time.
   The default resides in the parameter file for the robot that is loaded or used when a
   connection is made.  If you want to tune this more you can, by
   finding a different scale factor.  (There is just one so there
   doesn't have to be alot of calibration in flash that is lost if
   parameters are loaded from a file.)

   General notes on gyros and inertial correction: The purpose of the gyro is to
   correct for wheel slippage and large errors. It is not to totally correct
   for all errors, but to bring the errors into smaller zones that
   software can correct for more easily (such as by localization).
   We have found that if gyros or inertial measurement devices are used to attempt to
   correct for all error, the result can be not very robust, and include
   many problematic assumptions. For this reason, we have found that
   it is best to integrate this one simple gyro to simply improve robot odometry,
   rather than a complicated and expensive IMU.
