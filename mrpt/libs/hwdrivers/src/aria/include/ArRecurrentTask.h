/// Recurrent task (runs in its own thread)
/**
   The ArRecurrentTask is a task that runs in its own thread.  Recurrent
   tasks are asynchronous tasks that complete in a finite amount of time,
   and need to be reinvoked recurrently.  A typical example is Saphira's
   localization task: it runs for a few hundred milliseconds, localizes the
   robot, and returns.  Then the cycle starts over.
   The user simply needs to derive their own class
   from ArRecurrentTask and define the task() function.  This is the user
   code that will be called to execute the task body.
   Then, create an object of the class, and call the go() function to 
   start the task.  The status of the task can be checked with the
   done() function, which returns 0 if running, 1 if completed, and 2 if
   killed.  
   go() can be called whenever the task is done to restart it.  To stop the
   task in midstream, call reset().  
   kill() kills off the thread, shouldn't be used unless exiting the 
   async task permanently
