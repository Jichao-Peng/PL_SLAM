/// This action goes to a given ArPose very naively

/**
   This action naively drives straight towards a given ArPose. The
   action stops the robot when it has travelled the distance that that
   pose is away. It travels at 'speed' mm/sec.

   You can give it a new goal pose with setGoal(), cancel its movement
   with cancelGoal(), and see if it got there with haveAchievedGoal().

   For arguments to the goals and encoder goals you can tell it to go
   backwards by calling them with the backwards parameter true.  If
   you set the justDistance to true it will only really care about
   having driven the distance, if false it'll try to get to the spot
   you wanted within close distance.

   This doesn't avoid obstacles or anything, you could add have an obstacle
   avoidance ArAction at a higher priority to try to do this. (For
   truly intelligent navigation, see ActivMedia's ARNL software.)
