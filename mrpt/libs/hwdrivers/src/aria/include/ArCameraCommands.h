/// Commands that are supported by the camera (ArPTZ) and video classes.
/**
 * ArCameraCommands defines the commands that are commonly supported by 
 * the Aria camera and video classes.  The commands that are actually 
 * supported for a particular camera are specified in the ArCameraCollection.
 * <p>
 * There are basically two classes of commands:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Double Format Commands:  These commands use the new double interface 
 *   to the Aria camera classes.  They are generally preferred for future
 *   development since they provide finer control over the camera movements. 
 *   In addition, only these commands will work correctly in a multi-camera 
 *   configuration.</li>
 * 
 *   <li>Integer Format Commands:  These commands are maintained for backwards 
 *   compatibility.  They will not work correctly in a multi-camera 
 *   configuration.  (Only the first camera will be used.)</li>
 * </ol>
