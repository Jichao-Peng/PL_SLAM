/// Base class which handles the PTZ cameras
/**
    This class is mainly concerned with making all the cameras look
    the same for outgoing data, it is also set up to facilitate the
    acquisition of incoming data but that is described in the
    following paragraphs.  There are two ways this can be used.  The
    first is the simplest and default behavior and should be used by
    those whose cameras are attached to their robot's microcontroller,
    a ArRobot pointer is passed in to the contructor, this is where
    the commands will be sent to the robot via the robot's connection
    which will then send it along over the second serial port.  The
    second way is to pass an ArDeviceConnection to
    setDeviceConnection, if this is done commands will be sent along
    the given serial port, this should ONLY be done if the camera is
    attached straight to a serial port on the computer this program is
    running on.

    The next two paragraphs describe how to get data back from the
    cameras, but this base class is set up so that by default it won't
    try to get data back and assumes you're not trying to do that.  If
    you are trying to get data back the important functions are
    packetHandler, robotPacketHandler and readPacket and you should
    read the docs on those.

    If the camera is attached to the robot (and you are thus using the
    first method described in the first paragraph) then the only way
    to get data back is to send an ArCommands::GETAUX, then set up a
    robotPacketHandler for the AUX id and have it call the
    packetHandler you set up in in the class.

    If the camera is attached to the serial port on the computer (and
    thus the second method described in the first paragraph was used)
    then its more complicated... the default way is to just pass in an
    ArDeviceConnection to setDeviceConnection and implement the
    readPacket method (which MUST not block), and every time through
    the robot loop readPacket (with the sensorInterpHandler) will be
    called and any packets will be given to the packetHandler (which
    you need to implement in your class) to be processed.  The other
    way to do this method is to pass both an ArDefaultConnection and
    false to setDeviceConnection, this means the camera will not be
    read at all by default, and you're on your own for reading the
    data in (ie like your own thread).
